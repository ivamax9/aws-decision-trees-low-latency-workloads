# AWS Decision Trees For Low Latency Workloads Implementation

This repository contains a collection of decision trees to help you choose the appropriate AWS services for implementing low latency workloads. Each decision tree focuses on a specific aspect of the architecture and guides you through the decision-making process using interactive Mermaid diagrams.

## Overview

The decision trees are organized into six main categories:

1. [Edge and Regional Services](1.edge_and_regional.md)

2. [Routing and Load Balancing](2.routing_and_balancing.md)

3. [Compute Services](3.compute.md)

4. [Storage Services](4.storage.md)

5. [Database Services](5.databases.md)

6. [Application Integration](6.application_integration.md)

## How to Use

1. Each markdown file contains an interactive Mermaid diagram
2. Start at the top of each diagram and follow the decision paths
3. Answer the questions at each node to find the recommended service
4. Click the service links to access AWS documentation
5. Consider combining recommendations from multiple diagrams for complete solutions

## Contributing

These decision trees are maintained in Mermaid format for easy version control and updates. Feel free to:
- Suggest improvements to decision flows
- Add new service options as they become available
- Report any errors or unclear decision points
